# ATM Simulator
This repository contains a Python-based ATM Simulator project. The simulator mimics the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), allowing users to perform various banking operations.

## Features
### User Authentication: Users are required to enter credentials to access their accounts.
### Account Balance Inquiry: Check the available balance in a user’s account.
### Cash Withdrawal: Withdraw a specified amount of cash from the account, with checks for sufficient balance.
### Deposit: Deposit cash into the user’s account.
### Transaction History: Display the user’s recent transactions.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Any additional Python libraries (if used) should be installed as well.
## Usage
The ATM Simulator allows users to interact with a simulated ATM system by performing basic operations such as balance checks, withdrawals, and deposits. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.

## How It Works
### Login: Users input their account number and PIN to log in.
### Select Operation: Once logged in, users can:
Check balance
Withdraw money
Deposit money
View transaction history
### Logout: Users can log out after completing their transactions.
